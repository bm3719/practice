-- ++ concatenates lists, including strings (which are just lists of Chars).

-- The cons operator (:), conses stuff to lists.
-- 'A':" SMALL CAT"

-- Use !! to access âˆˆs of a list.
-- [1,2,3,4,5] !! 3

-- Comparison operators can be used on lists, where they are applied in
-- lexicographic order.  Subsequent elements are compared when the previous
-- comparison are equal.
-- [3,2,1] > [2,1,0]

-- List operations: head, tail, last, init (same as but-last in Clojure),
-- length, null (same as empty?), reverse, take, drop, maximum, minimum, sum,
-- product, elem (member predicate).

-- Ranges: Possible to specify a step, like [2,4..20].  To make decrementing
-- lists, a comma is needed, like [20,19..1].
