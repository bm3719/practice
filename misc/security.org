** Measuring and weighing risk
*** risk assessment
A process conducted in which threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts of a loss
are assessed.  Determines which risks are real/likely.  Coordination with the
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) determines course of action.
*** computing risk assessment
Prioritize and determine which risks are acceptable.  NIST provides a guide
for conducting assessments.
*** risk calculations
Risk impact terms:
- ALE: Annual Loss Expectancy.  A monetary measure of loss, every year.
- SLE: Single Loss Expectancy.  A monetary measure of loss for one event.  This
  is divided into AV (asset value) and EF (exposure factor).  SLE = AV * EF.
- ARO: Annualized Rate of Occurance.  Chance of an event occurring within a
  year, based on historical data.

Formula: SLE * ARO = ALE
*** quantitative vs. qualitative risk assessment
Risk assessments are either qualitative (opinion-based and subjective) or
qualitative (cost-based and objective).  If a dollar cost can be assigned,
it's quantitative.
*** additional risk terminology
- Likelihood: A score representing the possibility of threat initiation.  Goes
  from 10-0, with 10 being a certainty that the adversary will initiate a
  threat event.
- Threat vector: The way in which an attacker poses a threat.
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): The measure of the anticipated incidence
  of failure for a system or component.  E.g., if a system's MTBF is 1 year,
  expect to replace it once a year.
- Mean Time to Failure (MTTF): The average time to failure for a
  non-repairable system.  Same as MTBF, but for non-repairable systems.
- Mean Time to Restore (MTTR): How long it takes to repair a system once a
  failure occurs.
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The maximum amount of downtime considered
  acceptable.  Agreed upon during BIA creation.
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The point in time from which the system needs
  to be restored.  The shorter the RPO time, the more expensive.
- Service Level Agreement (SLA)
*** acting on your risk assessment
- Risk Avoidance: Identifying a risk and deciding not to engage in actions
  associated with it.
- Risk Transference: Sharing some of the burden of the risk with another
  entity (e.g. using insurance).
- Risk Mitigation: Taking steps to reduce a risk.  E.g., Data Loss Prevention
  (DLP) systems monitor the content of systems ensure key content is not
  deleted/removed.
- Risk Deterrence: Warning the adversary about consequences, like posting
  prosecution policies or warning of intrusion detection.
- Risk Acceptance: The choice to make when the cost of implementing the other
  choices outweighs the harm of an identified risk.
*** risks associated with cloud computing
Cloud computing implementations:
- PaaS: Vendors allow apps to be created an run on their infrastructure.
  E.g., AWS and Google Code.
- SaaS: Applications are remotely run over the Web.
- IaaS: Virtualized resources, billed by resource usage.

Risk-related issues:
- Regulatory compliance
- User privileges: Enforcing least privileges, reduced control.
- Data integration/segregation: Shared resources up data
  encryption/segregation requirements.
*** risks associated with virtualization
- Breaking out of the VM: Data access issues.
- Network and security controls can intermingle: Granularity differences
  between network and VM admin tools.
- Most attacks occur through the hypervisor, giving attackers root-level
  access to all VMs.
*** developing policies, standards, and guidelines
- 
** Monitoring and diagnosing networks
** Understanding devices and infrastructure
