# 1. It's just the base class all classes inherit from.
# 2. Yes.  You can pass types around, for example.
# 3. Uh, I get it.
# 4. Skipping.
# 5. This would just mean adding a list as a field to a class.
# 6. Python supports multiple inheritance.  I agree that it's generally a good
#    idea to avoid this when possible.
