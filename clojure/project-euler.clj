;; 
;; If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we

;; Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

;; #2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
;;
;; Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
;; two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
;;
;; 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
;;
;; By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
;; exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
