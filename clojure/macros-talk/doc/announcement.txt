Code that writes code (that writes code)

For this meetup, we'll take a break from our series of theory deep-dives and
collectively level up the local Clojure community with a discussion about
macros.  Though used everywhere by our heavily-bearded peers in the Common Lisp
world, most Clojure programmers tend to not use them very much, or at all.
Macros, however, are a critical feature of Clojure, and there are some key
applications for them that everyone should know.

We'll cover when you should use macros, when you shouldn't, compare Clojure
macros to similar facilities in other languages, share a few macro-related
tips, and maybe write some code to flex our macro-fu.

Pizzas and drinks will be provided by Whiteboard Federal.  Call Bruce at the
number provided if you have any issues entering the facility.
