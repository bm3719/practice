* macros-talk

This project represents a talk about macro usage, specifically in Clojure.

These concepts were presented at the National Capital Area Clojure Users Group
on 2017-06-14.  See the [[https://www.meetup.com/Cap-Clug/events/239289076/][event page]] for details.

* Usage

The only code in this project is in =dev/user.clj=.

There is also a [[doc/presentation.org][presentation]] in org-mode (to be used with org-present) in the
=doc/= directory.  Open this file in Emacs and run ~M-x org-present~.  This
requires the org-present package.
