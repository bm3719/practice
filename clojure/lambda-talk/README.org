* lambda-talk

This is a demonstration project used to illustrate a few basic concepts in the
λ-calculus.

These concepts will be presented at the National Capital Area Clojure Users
Group on 2017-08-09.  See the [[https://www.meetup.com/Cap-Clug/events/240747487/][event page]] for details.

* Usage

The Clojure part of this application is only intended to be used from the REPL.

There is also a presentation in org-mode (to be used with org-present) in the
=doc/= directory.  Open this file in Emacs and run ~M-x org-present~.  You'll, of
course, need to have installed the org-present package.

Pro-tip: Bind a key to Unicode characters when using them regularly in Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-l") (lambda () (interactive) (insert-char ?λ)))
#+END_SRC
