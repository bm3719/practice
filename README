This is a collection of everything that isn't really worthy of it's
own repository.  This includes:

- Practice code.  I generally prefer to learn and hone my skills in
  languages while writing code in it.  I've started saving some of
  this, as it often comes in handy.

- Exercises/notes from books: I read a ton of programming and computer
  science books.  If the book is structured in a way that lends itself
  to writing code along with it, taking semi-formal notes, or doing
  practice problems, I'll save that here.

- Exploratory code: Any decent programmer writes a lot of this type of
  code to find out what issues implementing an idea might raise or if
  the idea will even work at all.  Whatever of this I don't toss will
  go in here.

I'm leaving out stuff that is super trivial though.  This is ordered
by primary language for navigation ease.
